make simple twin stick controls(move and shoot)

use groups to store enemies that appear from offscreen, and move towards player's position
use sprites for enemies (pygame.sprite.Group)and player

make the user fire while button is pressed

eventually switch sprites and create animation

decrease size of player sprites or make the screen scrolling.

for testing, allow keyboard or controller input



Make changes to make it work without controller
	check player.get_event()
	player.update_location
	player.set_position
	player.__init__
	
	event_loop assigns self.keys
	which stores all the keys sethello
